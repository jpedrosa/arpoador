# Arpoador
The motivation for this project is to experiment with ideas for Fletch. Fletch is a VM that uses the Dart language.

Arpoador is a Portuguese word that means Harpoon Thrower.

In order to add more ffi calls, I've had to copy some of Fletch's code into the
MoreSys and File classes. I'm including [Fletch's License](Fletch_LICENSE.md)
in the project now as well.
